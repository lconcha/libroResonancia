	abstractnote = {It has long been recognized that the diffusion tensor model is inappropriate to characterize complex fiber architecture, causing tensor-derived measures such as the primary eigenvector and fractional anisotropy to be unreliable or misleading in these regions. There is however still debate about the impact of this problem in practice. A recent study using a Bayesian automatic relevance detection (ARD) multicompartment model suggested that a third of white matter (WM) voxels contain crossing fibers, a value that, whilst already significant, is likely to be an underestimate. The aim of this study is to provide more robust estimates of the proportion of affected voxels, the number of fiber orientations within each WM voxel, and the impact on tensor-derived analyses, using large, high-quality diffusion-weighted data sets, with reconstruction parameters optimized specifically for this task. Two reconstruction algorithms were used: constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), and the ARD method used in the previous study. We estimate the proportion of WM voxels containing crossing fibers to be ∼90\% (using CSD) and 63\% (using ARD). Both these values are much higher than previously reported, strongly suggesting that the diffusion tensor model is inadequate in the vast majority of WM regions. This has serious implications for downstream processing applications that depend on this model, particularly tractography, and the interpretation of anisotropy and radial/axial diffusivity measures.

It does so at realistic SNR levels achievable in limited time on a high-performance 3T system for the whole human brain in vivo. We use both computational simulations and in vivo brain scans to quantify the angular resolution of two selected reconstruction methods: Q-ball imaging and the diffusion orientation transform. We propose a new analytical solution to the ODF derived from the DOT. Both techniques are analytical decomposition approaches that require identical acquisition and modest postprocessing times and, given the proposed modifications of the DOT, can be analyzed in a similar fashion. We find that an optimal HARDI protocol given a stringent time constraint (<10 min) combines a moderate b-value (around 2000 s/mm(2)) with a relatively low number of acquired directions (>48). Our findings generalize to other methods and additional improvements in MR acquisition techniques.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is most commonly based on echo-planar imaging (EPI). With higher field strengths, gradient performance, and computational power, real-time fMRI has become feasible; that is, brain activation can be monitored during the ongoing scan. However, EPI suffers from geometric distortions due to inhomogeneities of the magnetic field, especially close to air-tissue interfaces. Thus, functional activations might be mislocalized and assigned to the wrong anatomical structures. Several techniques have been reported which reduce geometric distortions, for example, mapping of the static magnetic field B(0) or the point spread function for all voxels. Yet these techniques require additional reference scans and in some cases extensive computational time. Moreover, only static field inhomogeneities can be corrected, because the correction is based on a static reference scan. We present an approach which allows for simultaneous acquisition and distortion correction of a functional image without a reference scan. The technique is based on a modified multi-echo EPI data acquisition scheme using a phase-encoding (PE) gradient with alternating polarity. The images exhibit opposite distortions due to the inverted PE gradient. After adjusting the contrast of the images acquired at different echo times, this information is used for the distortion correction. We present the theory, implementation, and applications of this single-shot distortion correction. Significant reduction in geometric distortion is shown both for phantom images and human fMRI data. Moreover, sensitivity to the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) effect is increased by weighted summation of the undistorted images.},

These images, acquired by measuring the attenuation of NMR signal due to directionally dependent diffusion, have recently been shown to be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of acute stroke and in mapping of tissue structure. This work presents an improvement on the spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence that displays less distortion and consequently improves image quality. Adding a second refocusing pulse provides better image quality with less distortion at no cost in scanning efficiency or effectiveness, and allows more flexible diffusion gradient timing. By adjusting the timing of the diffusion gradients, eddy currents with a single exponential decay constant can be nulled, and eddy currents with similar decay constants can be greatly reduced. This new sequence is demonstrated in phantom measurements and in diffusion anisotropy images of normal human brain.},

Diffusion tensor imaging-derived tractography has been used for virtual dissection of the fornix and cingulum in healthy subjects, but not in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Eight patients with medically intractable TLE and unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis and nine healthy control subjects were imaged using diffusion tensor imaging. Fiber tracking was performed to delineate the fornix and cingulum, which were quantitatively analyzed. Bilateral symmetrical reduction in fractional anisotropy was observed in the fornix of patients with TLE, together with an increase in water mobility perpendicular to the axis of the fibers. The findings in the cingulum are similar to those of the fornix with the exception of significantly increased bulk diffusivity in the latter. We observed strikingly symmetrical bilateral abnormalities of axonal integrity in the fornix and cingulum in a series of patients with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis. Our findings suggest that TLE with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis is associated with bilateral limbic system pathology. Ann Neurol 2004.},

Sensitivity encoding (SENSE) is based on the fact that receiver sensitivity generally has an encoding effect complementary to Fourier preparation by linear field gradients. Thus, by using multiple receiver coils in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and k-space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one-half using a two-coil array in brain imaging. With an array of five coils double-oblique heart images were obtained in one-third of conventional scan time. Magn Reson Med 42:952-962, 1999.},

The anisotropy of DNMR for the nonmyelinated olfactory nerve argues strongly that myelin is not a necessary determinant of diffusional anisotropy in ordered axonal systems (even though it may contribute when present). Garfish nerves treated with vinblastine, in order to depolymerize microtubules and inhibit fast axonal transport, also exhibit diffusional anisotropy (DNMR(parallel)/DNMR(perpendicular) is 2.6 +/- 0.4, 2.8 +/- 0.8, and 2.2 +/- 0.7 for the olfactory, trigeminal, and optic nerves, respectively) thus excluding a significant role for microtubules and fast axonal transport in that observed anisotropy.},

@article{Concha_2005c,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The limbic system, relevant to memory and emotion, is an interesting subject of study in healthy and diseased individuals. It consists of a network of gray matter structures interconnected by white matter fibers. Although gray matter components of this system have been studied by using MR imaging, the connecting fibers have not been analyzed to the same degree. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal intensity contamination of the fornix and cingulum, the 2 major white matter tracts of the limbic system, can alter diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) measurements and affect tractography. We investigated the effect of CSF signal intensity suppression on fiber tracking of the limbic connections and characterized the diffusion properties of these structures in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Nine healthy individuals were scanned with standard and CSF-suppressed DTI. Tractography of the fornix and cingulum was performed for both acquisition methods. We report mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy measurements of the crus, body, and columns of the fornix, and descending, superior, and anterior portions of the cingulum. RESULTS: Diffusion measurements were improved and tractography was facilitated by using CSF-suppressed DTI. In particular, tract volume increased, whereas decreases of the mean diffusivity and increases of diffusion anisotropy more accurately represented the underlying tissue by minimizing deleterious partial volume averaging from CSF. This was particularly true for the fornix because it is in closest contact to CSF. Diffusion measurements throughout the limbic connections were consistent in healthy volunteers. CONCLUSION: We recommend the use of CSF suppression when performing diffusion-tensor tractography of the limbic system.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can resolve the white matter fiber orientation within a voxel provided that the fibers are strongly aligned. However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy. Ma},

Recently, investigators have proposed a method to image neural connectivity noninvasively using a magnetic resonance imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI measures the molecular diffusion of water along neural pathways. Accurate reconstruction of neural connectivity patterns from DTI has been hindered, however, by the inability of DTI to resolve more than a single axon direction within each imaging voxel. Here, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique that can resolve multiple axon directions within a single voxel. The technique, called q-ball imaging, can resolve intravoxel white matter fiber crossing as well as white matter insertions into cortex. The ability of q-ball imaging to resolve complex intravoxel fiber architecture eliminates a key obstacle to mapping neural connectivity in the human brain noninvasively.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a powerful tool for mapping neural histoarchitecture in vivo. However, DTI can only resolve a single fiber orientation within each imaging voxel due to the constraints of the tensor model. For example, DTI cannot resolve fibers crossing, bending, or twisting within an individual voxel. Intravoxel fiber crossing can be resolved using q-space diffusion imaging, but q-space imaging requires large pulsed field gradients and time-intensive sampling. It is also possible to resolve intravoxel fiber crossing using mixture model decomposition of the high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) signal, but mixture modeling requires a model of the underlying diffusion process.Recently, it has been shown that the HARDI signal can be reconstructed model-independently using a spherical tomographic inversion called the Funk-Radon transform, also known as the spherical Radon transform. The resulting imaging method, termed q-ball imaging, can resolve multiple intravoxel fiber orientations and does not require any assumptions on the diffusion process such as Gaussianity or multi-Gaussianity. The present paper reviews the theory of q-ball imaging and describes a simple linear matrix formulation for the q-ball reconstruction based on spherical radial basis function interpolation.

	abstract = {This work details the observation of non-Gaussian apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) profiles in multi-direction, diffusion-weighted MR data acquired with easily achievable imaging parameters (b approximately 1000 s/mm(2)). A technique is described for modeling the profile of the ADC over the sphere, which can capture non-Gaussian effects that can occur at, for example, intersections of different tissue types or white matter fiber tracts. When these effects are significant, the common diffusion tensor model is inappropriate, since it is based on the assumption of a simple underlying diffusion process, which can be described by a Gaussian probability density function. A sequence of models of increasing complexity is obtained by truncating the spherical harmonic (SH) expansion of the ADC measurements at several orders. Further, a method is described for selection of the most appropriate of these models, in order to describe the data adequately but without overfitting. The combined procedure is used to classify the profile at each voxel as isotropic, anisotropic Gaussian, or non-Gaussian, each with reference to the underlying probability density function of displacement of water molecules. We use it to show that non-Gaussian profiles arise consistently in various regions of the human brain where complex tissue structure is known to exist, and can be observed in data typical of clinical scanners. The performance of the procedure developed is characterized using synthetic data in order to demonstrate that the observed effects are genuine. This characterization validates the use of our method as an indicator of pathology that affects tissue structure, which will tend to reduce the complexity of the selected model.},

@article{Wright_1995,
	abstract = {We describe a novel technique for characterizing regional cerebral gray and white matter differences in structural magnetic resonance images by the application of methods derived from functional imaging. The technique involves automatic scalp-editing of images followed by segmentation, smoothing, and spatial normalization to a symmetrical template brain in stereotactic Talairach space. The basic idea is (i) to convert structural magnetic resonance image data into spatially normalized images of gray (or white) matter density, effected by segmenting the images and smoothing, and then (ii) to use Statistical Parametric Mapping to make inferences about the relationship between gray (or white) matter density and symptoms (or other pathophysiological measures) in a regionally specific fashion. Because the whole brain sum of gray (or white) matter indices is treated as a confound, the analysis reduces to a characterization of relative gray (or white) matter density on a voxel by voxel basis. We suggest that this is a powerful approach to voxel-based statistical anatomy. Using the technique, we constructed maps of the regional cerebral gray and white matter density correlates of syndrome scores (distinct psychotic symptoms) in a group of 15 schizophrenic patients. There was a negative correlation between the score for the reality distortion syndrome and regional gray matter density in the left superior temporal lobe (P = 0.01) and regional white matter density in the corpus callosum (P < 0.001). These abnormalities may be associated with functional changes predisposing to auditory hallucinations and delusions. This method permits the detection of structural differences within the entire brain (as opposed to selected regions of interest) and may be of value in the investigation of structural gray and white matter abnormalities in a variety of brain diseases.},

Bookstein's article entitled '"Voxel-Based Morphometry" Should Not Be Used with Imperfectly Registered Images' in this issue of NeuroImage. We will address three main issues: (i) Dr. Bookstein appears to have misunderstood the objective of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and the nature of the continuum we referred to. (ii) We agree with him when he states that findings from VBM can pertain to systematic registration errors during spatial normalization. (iii) His argument about voxelwise tests on smooth data holds in the absence of error variance, but is of no consequence when using actual data. We first review the tenets of VBM, paying particular attention to the relationship between VBM and tensor-based morphometry. The last two sections of this response deal with the specific concerns raised by Dr. Bookstein.},

Diffusion tensor imaging has previously been used to define large white-matter tracts in the living human brain, but this technique has had limited success in tracing pathways into gray matter. Here we identified specific connections between human thalamus and cortex using a novel probabilistic tractography algorithm with diffusion imaging data. Classification of thalamic gray matter based on cortical connectivity patterns revealed distinct subregions whose locations correspond to nuclei described previously in histological studies. The connections that we found between thalamus and cortex were similar to those reported for non-human primates and were reproducible between individuals.

The purpose of this paper is to use the orientation information contained in DTI to study axonal organization of the brain both macroscopically and quantitatively. After performing gray/white matter segmentation using a fractional anisotropy threshold, the white matter can be further decomposed into components composed of tracts oriented along three orthogonal anatomic axes (right-left, superior-inferior, and anterior-posterior). For each component, the volume and MR parameters were quantified. To characterize the axonal architecture of the brain, this technique was applied to the entire brain using a Talairach-based brain parcellation method and to the thalamus by manual segmentation. Reproducibility of this analysis tool was examined by repeating the measurements in the same subject, and individual differences were appreciated from the data acquired in 11 healthy volunteers. Based on the results from these preliminary data sets, this new analysis technique is expected to be an effective tool for macroscopic white matter characterization. Magn Reson Med 53:649-657, 2005.

@article{Jones_2005,
	abstract = {Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has been used to analyze diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) data in a number of studies. In VBM, following spatial normalization, data are smoothed to improve the validity of statistical inferences and to reduce inter-individual variation. However, the size of the smoothing filter used for VBM of DT-MRI data is highly variable across studies. For example, a literature review revealed that Gaussian smoothing kernels ranging in size (full width at half maximum) from zero to 16 mm have been used in DT-MRI VBM type studies. To investigate the effect of varying filter size in such analyses, whole brain DT-MRI data from 14 schizophrenic patients were compared with those of 14 matched control subjects using VBM, when the filter size was varied from zero to 16 mm. Within this range of smoothing, four different conclusions regarding apparent patient control differences could be made: (i) no significant patient-control differences; (ii) reduced FA in right superior temporal gyrus (STG) in patients; (iii) reduced FA in both right STG and left cerebellum in patients; and (iv) reduced FA only in left cerebellum in patients. These findings stress the importance of recognizing the effect of the matched filter theorem on VBM analyses of DT-MRI data. Finally, we investigated whether one of the underlying assumptions of parametric VBM, i.e., the normality of the residuals, is met. Our results suggest that, even with moderate smoothing, a large number of voxels within central white matter regions may have non-normally distributed residuals thus making valid statistical inferences with a parametric approach problematic in these areas.},

	abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies.

The aim of the study was to use a novel method for tract-specific measurements of fronto-temporal fasciculi in early-onset schizophrenia. We hypothesized that by making tract-specific measurements, clear diffusion abnormalities would be revealed in specific fasciculi in schizophrenia. Measurements of diffusion anisotropy and mean diffusivity were localized within fronto-temporal fasciculi by forming 3-D reconstructions of the cingulum, uncinate, superior longitudinal, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi using diffusion tensor tractography. We were limited in our ability to test our hypothesis by the important and surprising finding that age affected DT-MRI-based measures in schizophrenia patients in a different way from comparison subjects, most notably in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus. The youngest schizophrenia patients that we studied had lower diffusion anisotropy than age-matched comparison subjects, but this difference diminished with increasing age. The main conclusion of this study was that direct comparisons of absolute DT-MRI-based measures between individuals with schizophrenia and comparison subjects may be problematic and misleading because of underlying age-related differences in brain maturation between groups.},

	abstract = {Diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) provides information about the structural organization and orientation of white matter fibres and, through the technique of 'tractography', reveals the trajectories of cerebral white matter tracts. We used tractography in the living human brain to address the disputed issue of the nature of occipital and temporal connections. Classical anatomical studies described direct fibre connections between occipital and anterior temporal cortex in a bundle labelled the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). However, their presence has been challenged by more recent evidence suggesting that connections between the two regions are entirely indirect, conveyed by the occipito-temporal projection system–a chain of U-shaped association fibres. DT-MRI data were collected from 11 right-handed healthy subjects (mean age 33.3 +/- 4.7 years). Each data set was co-registered with a standard MRI brain template, and a group-averaged DT-MRI data set was created. 'Virtual' in vivo dissection of occipito-temporal connections was performed in the group-averaged data. Further detailed virtual dissection was performed on the single brain data sets. Our results suggest that in addition to the indirect connections of the occipito-temporal projection system: (i) a major associative connection between the occipital and anterior temporal lobe is provided by a fibre bundle whose origin, course and termination are consistent with classical descriptions of the ILF in man and with monkey visual anatomy; (ii) the tractography-defined ILF is structurally distinct from fibres of the optic radiation and from U-shaped fibres connecting adjacent gyri; (iii) it arises in extrastriate visual 'association' areas; and (iv) it projects to lateral and medial anterior temporal regions. While the function of the direct ILF pathway is unclear, it appears to mediate the fast transfer of visual signals to anterior temporal regions and neuromodulatory back-projections from the amygdala to early visual areas. Future tractography studies of patients with occipito-temporal disconnection syndromes may help define the functional roles of the direct and indirect occipito-temporal pathways.},

Most contemporary fiber orientation mapping schemes and tractography algorithms employ the directional information contained in the eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor to approximate white matter fiber orientation. However, while the uncertainty associated with every estimate of an eigenvector has long been recognized, no attempts to quantify this uncertainty in vivo have been reported. Here, a method is proposed for determining confidence intervals in fiber orientation from real DT-MRI data using the bootstrap method.

Understanding the organization of brain systems, especially those used for cognition, remains limited, however, because no methods currently exist for noninvasive tracking of neuronal connections between functional regions [Crick, F. \& Jones, E. (1993) Nature (London) 361, 109-110]. Detailed connectivities have been studied in animals through invasive tracer techniques, but these invasive studies cannot be done in humans, and animal results cannot always be extrapolated to human systems. We have developed noninvasive neuronal fiber tracking for use in living humans, utilizing the unique ability of MRI to characterize water diffusion. We reconstructed fiber trajectories throughout the brain by tracking the direction of fastest diffusion (the fiber direction) from a grid of seed points, and then selected tracks that join anatomically or functionally (functional MRI) defined regions. We demonstrate diffusion tracking of fiber bundles in a variety of white matter classes with examples in the corpus callosum, geniculo-calcarine, and subcortical association pathways. Tracks covered long distances, navigated through divergences and tight curves, and manifested topological separations in the geniculo-calcarine tract consistent with tracer studies in animals and retinotopy studies in humans. Additionally, previously undescribed topologies were revealed in the other pathways. This approach enhances the power of modern imaging by enabling study of fiber connections among anatomically and functionally defined brain regions in individual human subjects.},

First, we injected the tracer at multiple sites in the brain of a macaque monkey; second, we reconstructed the histological sections of the labeled fiber tracts in 3D; third, we segmented and registered the fibers (somatosensory and motor tracts) with the anatomical in-vivo MRI from the same animal; and last, we conducted fiber tracing along the same pathways on the DTI data using a classical diffusion tracing technique with the injection sites as seeds. To evaluate the performance of DTI fiber tracing, we compared the fibers derived from the DTI tractography with those segmented from the histology. We also studied the influence of the parameters controlling the tractography by comparing Dice superimposition coefficients between histology and DTI segmentations. While there was generally good visual agreement between the two methods, our quantitative comparisons reveal certain limitations of DTI tractography, particularly for regions at remote locations from seeds. We have thus demonstrated the importance of appropriate settings for realistic tractography results.},

While there is no doubt that DTI fiber tracking is providing exciting new opportunities to study CNS anatomy, it is very important to understand its limitations. In this review we therefore assess the basic principles and the assumptions that need to be made for each step of the study, including both data acquisition and the elaborate fiber reconstruction algorithms.

Simulations and imaging experiments on in vivo human brains were performed to investigate the behavior of the tractography algorithm. The simulations show that the deflection term is less sensitive than the major eigenvector to image noise. In the human brain imaging experiments, estimated tracts were generated in corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. This approach is promising for mapping the organizational patterns of white matter in the human brain as well as mapping the relationship between major fiber trajectories and the location and extent of brain lesions.

Such connectivity is conveyed by specific pathways or tracts in the white matter. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging detects the diffusivity of water molecules in three dimensions. Diffusivity is anisotropic in oriented tissues such as fiber tracts. In the present study, we used this method to map (in terms of orientation, location, and size) the "stem" (compact portion) of the principal association, projection, and commissural white matter pathways of the human brain in vivo, in 3 normal subjects. In addition, its use in clinical neurology is illustrated in a patient with left inferior parietal lobule embolic infarction in whom a significant reduction in relative size of the stem of the left superior longitudinal fasciculus was observed. This represents an important method for the characterization of major association pathways in the living human that are not discernible by conventional magnetic resonance imaging. In the clinical domain, this method will have a potential impact on the understanding of the diseases that involve white matter such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, head injury, and spinal cord injury.},

Numerous measures of diffusion anisotropy have been proposed, which could lead to confusion in interpreting and comparing results from different studies. In this study, a new method for representing the diffusion tensor shape, called the three-phase (3P) plot, is described. This is a graphical technique based upon a barycentric coordinate system, which weights the tensor shape by a combination of linear, cylindrical, and spherical shape factors. This coordinate system can be used to map and potentially segment different tissues based upon the tensor shape. In addition, the 3P plot can be used to examine the shape properties of existing measures of diffusion anisotropy. In this paper, the 3P plot is used to compare four well-known anisotropy measures: the anisotropy index, the fractional anisotropy, the relative anisotropy, and the volume fraction. Computer simulations and diffusion tensor images of normal brains were obtained to study the properties of this new mapping technique. Magn Reson Med 44:283-291, 2000.},

Here, using Monte Carlo simulations, we compare and contrast how noise complicates the measurement of diffusion anisotropy in diffusion tensor and conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). As the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases below a value of approximately 20, the eigenvalues (lambda(i)) of the diffusion tensor D are found to diverge rapidly from their true values, with the result that the measured anisotropy can be significantly in error and isotropic structures falsely assigned a high level of anisotropy. The effect of noise on the rotationally variant indices, calculated from a conventional diffusion-weighted imaging experiment, is found to be much less insidious, because the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) diverge only slowly as the signal-to-noise decreases. Thus, although rotationally variant indices almost always underestimate the true diffusion anisotropy, they show only a small susceptibility to experimental noise and hence, are preferred to their rotationally invariant counterparts when the signal-to-noise ratio is small.},

Nevertheless, determination of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the apparent diffusion tensor, D xi app, the necessary process for the treatment of D xi app in axonography, is cumbersome and the quality of the reconstructed images based on estimated parameter values of D xi app has often been disappointing. We present here a simple algorithm which allows for the extraction of the anisotropic term vector, DAapp, from D xi app in pictorial form, which in turn provides a novel color-coded contrast for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI images constructed using this technique, three-dimensional anisotropy contrast (3DAC), provided impressive anatomic resolution of the CNS, comparable to in vitro histology. Directional information of DAapp expressed by hue of color clearly correlated to fiber direction, while magnitude of DAapp expressed by intensity of color correlated to fiber diameter. Magnetic resonance axonography (MRX) utilizing 3DAC technique possesses significant potential for various biological and clinical applications.},

In this work, we present a method for exploiting this type of information to map the fiber orientations in the image plane. It makes use of three diffusion-weighted images with sensitizing gradients along x, y and u, an axis at 45 degrees with respect to x and y. The orientation information contained in these images is summarized in a single image representing the angle between the fiber direction and a fixed axis, making use of a cyclic color scale. The method is evaluated using computer simulations for a variety of diffusion weighting strengths and signal-to-noise ratios, tested on a phantom and illustrated on an in vivo example.

	abstract = {Our purpose was to use whole brain echo planar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify and characterize diffusion abnormalities in acute cerebral ischemia. We studied 40 patients as early as 3 hours after onset of signs and symptoms of cerebral ischemia. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the entire brain could be completed in 3 seconds or, using seven different diffusion sensitivities (maximum b = 1,271 sec/mm2), in 48 seconds. Measurements and synthetic maps were made of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC), a physiological parameter that characterizes the self-diffusion of water in tissue. Early ischemic lesions were identified with DWI as hyperintense regions of decreased ADC in all patients who subsequently developed infarction, before changes were evident on conventional MRI in cases studied earlier than 6 hours after onset of ischemic symptoms. Lesions as small as 4 mm in diameter were identified. The extent of lesions within white matter was best defined by controlling for the anisotropic effect of axonal orientation. The mean ADC (+/- SD) for control regions in the 36 patients was 9.15 (+/- 2.91) x 10(-4) mm2/sec. Mean ADC of ischemic regions was 56\% of control values at 6 hours or less and stayed significantly reduced for 3 to 4 days after onset of ischemia. The relative ADC increased progressively over time to be pseudonormalized at 5 to 10 days and elevated in the chronic state, making the distinction of acute lesions adjacent to chronic infarcts readily apparent. DWI with echo planar imaging measures a unique physiological parameter that is sensitive to ischemic changes before conventional MRI. Its potential role in the quantitative study of human stroke pathophysiology and therapeutics is the subject of further investigation.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of single diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) measurements depends upon the encoding scheme used. In this study, the diffusion tensor accuracy of several strategies for DT-MRI encoding are compared. The encoding strategies are based upon heuristic, numerically optimized, and regular polyhedra schemes. The criteria for numerical optimization include the minimum tensor variance (MV), minimum force (MF), minimum potential energy (ME), and minimum condition number. The regular polyhedra scheme includes variations of the icosahedron. Analytical comparisons and Monte Carlo simulations show that the icosahedron scheme is optimum for six encoding directions. The MV, MF, and ME solutions for six directions are functionally equivalent to the icosahedron scheme. Two commonly used heuristic DT-MRI encoding schemes with six directions, which are based upon the geometric landmarks of a cube (vertices, edge centers, and face centers), are found to be suboptimal. For more than six encoding directions, many methods are able to generate a set of equivalent optimum encoding directions including the regular polyhedra, and the ME, MF and MV numerical optimization solutions. For seven directions, a previously described heuristic encoding scheme (tetrahedral plus x, y, z) was also found to be optimum. This study indicates that there is no significant advantage to using more than six encoding directions as long as an optimum encoding is used for six directions. Future DT-MRI studies are necessary to validate these observations. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:769-780. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Specifically, these parameters are objective, and insensitive to the choice of laboratory coordinate system. Here, these two properties are used to derive intravoxel measures of diffusion isotropy and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as intervoxel measures of structural similarity, and fiber-tract organization from the effective diffusion tensor, D, which is estimated in each voxel. First, D is decomposed into its isotropic and anisotropic parts, [D] I and D - [D] I, respectively (where [D] = Trace(D)/3 is the mean diffusivity, and I is the identity tensor). Then, the tensor (dot) product operator is used to generate a family of new rotationally and translationally invariant quantities. Finally, maps of these quantitative parameters are produced from high-resolution diffusion tensor images (in which D is estimated in each voxel from a series of 2D-FT spin-echo diffusion-weighted images) in living cat brain. Due to the high inherent sensitivity of these parameters to changes in tissue architecture (i.e., macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and organ structure) and in its physiologic state, their potential applications include monitoring structural changes in development, aging, and disease.},

	abstract = {A diffusion imaging method with a tetrahedral sampling pattern has been developed for high-sensitivity diffusion analysis. The tetrahedral gradient pattern consists of four different combinations of x, y, and z gradients applied simultaneously at full strength to uniformly measure diffusion in four different directions. Signal-to-noise can be increased by up to a factor of about three using this approach, compared with diffusion measurements made using separately applied x, y, and z gradients. A mathematical formalism is presented describing six fundamental parameters: the directionally averaged diffusion coefficient D and diffusion element anisotropies eta and epsilon which are rotationally invariant, and diffusion ellipsoid orientation angles theta, phi, and omega which are rotationally variant. These six parameters contain all the information in the symmetric diffusion tensor D. Principal diffusion coefficients, reduced anisotropies, and other rotational invariants are further defined. It is shown that measurement of off-diagonal tensor elements is essential to assess anisotropy and orientation, and that the only parameter which can be measured with the orthogonal method is D. In cases of axial diffusion symmetry (e.g., fibers), the four tetrahedral diffusion measurements efficiently enable determination of D, eta, theta, and phi which contain all the diffusion information. From these four parameters, the diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the symmetry axis (D and D) and the axial anisotropy A can be determined. In more general cases, the six fundamental parameters can be determined with two additional diffusion measurements. Tetrahedral diffusion sequences were implemented on a clinical MR system. A muscle phantom demonstrates orientation independence of D, D, D, and A for large changes in orientation angles. Sample background gradients and diffusion gradient imbalances were directly measured and found to be insignificant in most cases.},

	abstract = {Diffusion-weighted MR images were compared with T2-weighted MR images and correlated with 1H spin-echo and 31P MR spectroscopy for 6-8 h following a unilateral middle cerebral and bilateral carotid artery occlusion in eight cats. Diffusion-weighted images using strong gradient strengths (b values of 1413 s/mm2) displayed a significant relative hyperintensity in ischemic regions as early as 45 min after onset of ischemia whereas T2-weighted spin-echo images failed to clearly demonstrate brain injury up to 2-3 h postocclusion. Signal intensity ratios (SIR) of ischemic to normal tissues were greater in the diffusion-weighted images at all times than in either TE 80 or TE 160 ms T2-weighted MR images. Diffusion- and T2-weighted SIR did not correlate for the first 1-2 h postocclusion. Good correlation was found between diffusion-weighted SIR and ischemic disturbances of energy metabolism as detected by 31P and 1H MR spectroscopy. Diffusion-weighted hyperintensity in ischemic tissues may be temperature-related, due to rapid accumulation of diffusion-restricted water in the intracellular space (cytotoxic edema) resulting from the breakdown of the transmembrane pump and/or to microscopic brain pulsations.},

	abstract = {Both axon and myelin degeneration have significant impact on the long-term disability of patients with white matter disorder. However, the clinical manifestations of the neurological dysfunction caused by white matter disorders are not sufficient to determine the origin of neurological deficits. A noninvasive biological marker capable of detecting and differentiating axon and myelin degeneration would be a significant addition to currently available tools. Directional diffusivities derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been previously proposed by this group as potential biological markers to detect and differentiate axon and myelin degeneration. To further test the hypothesis that axial (lambdaparallel) and radial (lambdaperpendicular) diffusivities reflect axon and myelin pathologies, respectively, the optic nerve was examined serially using DTI in a mouse model of retinal ischemia. A significant decrease of lambdaparallel, the putative DTI axonal marker, was observed 3 days after ischemia without concurrently detectable changes in lambdaperpendicular, the putative myelin marker. This result is consistent with histological findings of significant axonal degeneration with no detectable demyelination at 3 days after ischemia. The elevation of lambdaperpendicular observed 5 days after ischemia is consistent with histological findings of myelin degeneration at this time. These results support the hypothesis that lambdaparallel and lambdaperpendicular hold promise as specific markers of axonal and myelin injury, respectively, and, further, that the coexistence of axonal and myelin degeneration does not confound this utility.},

@article{Jones_2004,
	abstract = {There are conflicting opinions in the literature as to whether it is more beneficial to use a large number of gradient sampling orientations in diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) experiments than to use a smaller number of carefully chosen orientations. In this study, Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the effect of using different gradient sampling schemes on estimates of tensor-derived quantities assuming a b-value of 1000 smm(-2). The study focused in particular on the effect that the number of unique gradient orientations has on uncertainty in estimates of tensor-orientation, and on estimates of the trace and anisotropy of the diffusion tensor. The results challenge the recently proposed notion that a set of six icosahedrally-arranged orientations is optimal for DT-MRI. It is shown that at least 20 unique sampling orientations are necessary for a robust estimation of anisotropy, whereas at least 30 unique sampling orientations are required for a robust estimation of tensor-orientation and mean diffusivity. Finally, the performance of sampling schemes that use low numbers of sampling orientations, but make efficient use of available gradient power, are compared to less efficient schemes with larger numbers of sampling orientations, and the relevant scenarios in which each type of scheme should be used are discussed.},

We decided to estimate the total number of neocortical neurons in the normal human brain and to analyze it with respect to the major macro- and microscopical structural components, to study the internal relationships of these components, and to quantitate the influence of important physiological variables on brain structure. The 94 brains reported represent a consecutive collection of brains from the general Danish population. The average numbers of neocortical neurons were 19 billion in female brains and 23 billion in male brains, a 16\% difference. In our study, which covered the age range from 20 years to 90 years, approximately 10\% of all neocortical neurons are lost over the life span in both sexes. Sex and age were the main determinants of the total number of neurons in the human neocortex, whereas body size, per se, had no influence on neuron number. Some of the data presented have been analyzed by using new mathematical designs. An equation predicting the total neocortical neuron number in any individual in which sex and age are known is provided.},

The total length of the myelinated fibers of the white matter in the elderly group of 86,000 km was, statistically, significantly decreased by 27\% compared with 118,000 km in the young group. This loss of the total nerve fiber length was accompanied in particular by a decline of the myelinated fibers with a small diameter. The mean diameter of the myelinated fibers in the young group was significantly smaller than in the old group, but the relative size distributions of the myelinated fiber diameters between the young and old groups were similar. Our findings show that the atrophy of the human white matter during ageing is probably caused by a loss of myelinated fibers with a small diameter.},

@article{Sotak_2002,
	abstract = {Water diffusion in brain tissue is affected by the presence of barriers to translational motion such as cell membranes and myelin fibers. The measured water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value is therefore frequently anisotropic and varies depending upon the orientation of restricting barriers (such as white matter tracts) relative to the diffusion-sensitive-gradient direction. Anisotropic water diffusion can be specified using indices of diffusion anisotropy [e.g. standard deviation of the individual ADC values, fractional anisotropy (FA), lattice index (LI)], which are derived from measurements of the full diffusion tensor. The rotationally invariant nature of particular diffusion anisotropy indices (e.g. FA, LI) allows orientation-independent comparisons of these parameters between different subjects. Pathophysiological processes (such as cerebral ischemia) that modify the integrity of the tissue microstructure result in significant alterations in tissue anisotropy and make this metric a useful endpoint for characterizing the temporal evolution of the disease. Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) studies of both experimental and human stroke suggest that DTI may provide additional information about the evolution of the disease that is not available from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) alone. Acute reductions in the average diffusivity [<D> = (lambda(1) + lambda(2) + lambda(3))/3 where lambda(1), lambda(2), and lambda(3) are the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor] following the onset of cerebral ischemia are often accompanied by increases in diffusion anisotropy. In the transition from acute to sub-acute and chronic stroke, <D> renormalizes and subsequently increases whereas diffusion anisotropy measures (e.g. FA) decline and remained reduced in chronic infarcts. Overall isotropic ADC changes during infarct evolution have been observed to be greater in white matter (WM) than in gray matter (GM) lesions (although there have been conflicting reports on this issue) and GM lesions tend to renormalize prior to WM lesions as the infarct evolves. Ischemic WM exhibits a significant decrease in diffusion anisotropy (relative to normal WM) during ischemic evolution whereas that of ischemic GM remains statistically unchanged. Furthermore, the percentage decrease in ischemic WM <D> is largely determined by reductions in lambda(1), the eigenvalue that coincides with the long axis of the WM fiber tract. Variations in unidirectional ADC or <D> over the ischemic time course limit the usefulness of this parameter alone as a predictor of ischemic injury. Consequently, ADC information has been combined with that of other MR parameters (including DTI) to unambiguously stage and predict ischemic brain injury over its entire temporal evolution. Combined <D> and diffusion anisotropy measurements have identified three phases of diffusion abnormality: (1) reduced <D> and elevated anisotropy; (2) reduced <D> and reduced anisotropy; and (3) elevated <D> and reduced anisotropy. However, variations in the differential patterns of <D> and diffusion anisotropy evolution have been observed by a number of investigators and more work is needed to clarify the role of these measurements in characterizing the severity of the ischemic insult as well as the potential outcome in response to the initial ischemic injury. The use of DTI, in combination with more sophisticated analysis methods for performing multiparametric segmentation, such as multispectral analysis, may enhance the use of MRI for accurate diagnosis and prognosis of stroke. Furthermore, these techniques may also play an important role in the clinical evaluation of new stroke treatments. Copyright 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The pulsed-gradient experiment is preferred to the steady-gradient experiment because it affords better definition and control over the time during which diffusion is observed. Diffusion times between 1 sec and 10–3 sec have been used. One artificial system of thin liquid layers, three different kinds of plant cells, and one emulsion have been studied. Clear indications of restricted diffusion are found in all the systems. When fitted to theoretical expressions derived for such behavior, the data yielded a description of each system, as seen by the diffusing molecules, adequately in agreement with the known structure and properties. Critiera for recognizing and analyzing restricted diffusion are discussed.

The fact that water diffusion is sensitive to the underlying tissue microstructure provides a unique method of assessing the orientation and integrity of these neural fibres, which may be useful in assessing a number of neurological disorders. The purpose of this review is to characterize the relationship of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of water diffusion and its anisotropy (i.e. directional dependence) with the underlying microstructure of neural fibres. The emphasis of the review will be on model neurological systems both in vitro and in vivo. A systematic discussion of the possible sources of anisotropy and their evaluation will be presented followed by an overview of various studies of restricted diffusion and compartmentation as they relate to anisotropy. Pertinent pathological models, developmental studies and theoretical analyses provide further insight into the basis of anisotropic diffusion and its potential utility in the nervous system.},

@article{Berry_Geim_1997,
	abstractnote = {Diamagnetic objects are repelled by magnetic fields. If the fields are strong enough, this repulsion can balance gravity, and objects levitated in this way can be held in stable equilibrium, apparently violating Earnshaw’s theorem. In fact Earnshaw’s theorem does not apply to induced magnetism, and it is possible for the total energy (gravitational + magnetic) to possess a minimum. General stability conditions are derived, and it is shown that stable zones always exist on the axis of a field with rotational symmetry, and include the inflection point of the magnitude of the field. For the field inside a solenoid, the zone is calculated in detail; if the solenoid is long, the zone is centred on the top end, and its vertical extent is about half the radius of the solenoid. The theory explains recent experiments by Geim et al, in which a variety of objects (one of which was a living frog) was levitated in a field of about 16 T. Similar ideas explain the stability of a spinning magnet above a magnetized base plate. Stable levitation of paramagnets is impossible. Samenvatting. Magnetische velden stoten diamagnetische voorwerpen af. Zulke velden kunnen zo sterk zijn dat zij de zwaartekracht opheffen. Het is op deze wijze mogelijk zulke voorwerpen te laten zweven. Dit vormt een stabiel evenwicht, wat in tegenspraak schijnt te zijn met Earnshaw’s Theorema. Echter Earnshaw’s Theorema is niet langer geldig als het magnetisme veld geinduceerd is. De totale energie (bevattende bijdragen van het magnetisme en de zwaartekracht) kan toch een lokaal minimum vertonen. Algemene criteria voor zo’n minimum zullen worden opgesteld. Verder zal worden aangetoond dat voor een cilindrisch symmetrisch veld, langs zijn symmetrie as altijd een zone gevonden kan worden waarin een stabiel evenwicht bestaat. Voor het veld binnen een solenoïde zal deze zone in detail bepaald worden. Als deze spoel voldoende land is bevindt deze zone zich aan het uiteinde van de spoel.

	abstract = {Old age and possession of the APOE-4 allele are the two main risk factors for developing later onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Carriers of the APOE-4 allele have known differences in intrinsic functional brain network activity across the life span. These individuals also demonstrate specific regional differences in gray and white matter gross structure. However, the relationship of these variations to whole brain structural network connectivity remains unclear. We performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), T1 structural imaging, and cognitive testing on aging APOE-4 noncarriers (n = 30; mean age = 63.8±8.3) and APOE-4 carriers (n = 25; mean age = 60.8 ±9.7). Fiber tractography was used to derive whole brain structural graphs, and graph theory was applied to assess structural network properties. Network communication efficiency was determined for each network by quantifying local interconnectivity, global integration, and the balance between these, the small worldness. Relative to noncarriers, APOE-4 carriers demonstrated an accelerated age-related loss of mean local interconnectivity (r = -0.64, P ≤ 0.01) and regional local interconnectivity decreases in the precuneus (r = -0.64), medial orbitofrontal cortex (r = -0.5), and lateral parietal cortex (r = -0.54). APOE-4 carriers also showed significant age-related loss in mean cortical thickness (r = -0.52, P < 0.05). Cognitively, APOE-4 carriers had significant negative correlations of age and performance on two episodic memory tasks (P < 0.05). This genotype-specific pattern of structural connectivity change with age thus appears related to changes in gross cortical structure and cognition, potentially affecting the rate and/or spatial distribution of AD-related pathology.},

Our recent observations in functional MRI for the visual and motor cortex show very different results with sound noise in comparison with the results obtained without sound noise. Although a number of ideas have been suggested in the literature about the possible elimination or reduction of sound noise, progress has been slow due to the basic role of gradient pulsing in MR imaging. Before we tackle the sound-noise-reduction problem, we believe that a systematic study of sound or acoustic noise behavior will provide important information for future endeavors in this area of research in MRI systems, in both commercial and research systems. Therefore, we report on some typical behavior of sound noise observed from MRI scanners and the analyses of their characteristics. Data are obtained both from a commercial MRI scanner (GE Signa 1.5-T EPI system) as well as a research-type MRI scanner (KAIS 2.0-T) developed at a university laboratory setting.},

Experimental MRI systems with high magnetic field strengths may generate acoustic noise of higher sound pressure levels (SPLs) than conventional 1.0 and 1.5 T clinical systems. We measured the SPL and spectral content of the acoustic noise generated by the Bruker Biospect 47/40 4.7 T experimental MRI system during scanning sequences commonly used in animal testing. Each sequence generated acoustic noise of high SPL, rapid pulse rates, amplitude-modulated pulse envelopes and multi-peaked spectra. The rapid acquisition with enhancement sequence with a 0.25 mm slice thickness generated SPLs of up to 129 dB peak SPL and 130 dB (A). Fourier analysis of the spectral content of the acoustic noise generated by each MRI sequence showed a wide band of acoustic energy with spectral peaks from 0.2-5 kHz. The intense MRI acoustic impulse noise generated by the 4.7 T system may cause masking of stimuli used in fMRI of the auditory cortex, reduce the hearing acuity of experimental animals and present a risk for unprotected human ears.},

	abstract = {Dogs have a rich social relationship with humans. One fundamental aspect of it is how dogs pay close attention to human faces in order to guide their behavior, for example, by recognizing their owner and his/her emotional state using visual cues. It is well known that humans have specific brain regions for the processing of other human faces, yet it is unclear how dogs' brains process human faces. For this reason, our study focuses on describing the brain correlates of perception of human faces in dogs using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We trained seven domestic dogs to remain awake, still and unrestrained inside an MRI scanner. We used a visual stimulation paradigm with block design to compare activity elicited by human faces against everyday objects. Brain activity related to the perception of faces changed significantly in several brain regions, but mainly in the bilateral temporal cortex. The opposite contrast (i.e., everyday objects against human faces) showed no significant brain activity change. The temporal cortex is part of the ventral visual pathway, and our results are consistent with reports in other species like primates and sheep, that suggest a high degree of evolutionary conservation of this pathway for face processing. This study introduces the temporal cortex as candidate to process human faces, a pillar of social cognition in dogs.},

In this study, we compared MRI-derived entorhinal and hippocampal volume in healthy elderly controls, patients who presented at the clinic with cognitive complaints, but did not meet criteria for dementia (non-demented), and patients with very mild AD. The two patient groups differed significantly from controls in entorhinal volume, but not from each other; in contrast, they differed from each other, as well as from controls, in hippocampal volume, with the mild AD cases showing the greatest atrophy. Follow-up clinical evaluations available on 23/28 non-demented patients indicated that 12/23 had converted to AD within 12-77 months from the baseline MRI examination. Converters could be best differentiated from non-converters on the basis of entorhinal, but not hippocampal volume. These data suggest that although both the EC and hippocampal formation degenerate before the onset of overt dementia, EC volume is a better predictor of conversion.},

It is plausible that in the future MRM may depict Brodmann areas directly, and not only by inference from gross anatomic location. Our purpose was to depict the laminar cytoarchitecture of excised, formalin-fixed specimens of human cerebral cortex by use of 9.4-T MR and to correlate MR images with histologic stains of the same sections.Formalin-fixed samples of human sensory isocortex (calcarine, Heschl's, and somatosensory cortices), motor isocortex (hand motor area of M1), polar isocortex (frontal pole), allocortex (hippocampal formation), and transitional periallocortex (retrosplenial cortex) were studied by MRM at 9.4 T with intermediate-weighted pulse sequences for a total overnight acquisition time of 14 hours 17 minutes for each specimen. The same samples were then histologically analyzed to confirm the MR identification of the cortical layers. Curves representing the change in MR signal intensity across the cortex were generated to display the signal intensity profiles for each type of cortex.High-field-strength MR imaging at a spatial resolution of 78 x 78 x 500 micro m resolves the horizontal lamination of isocortex, allocortex, and periallocortex and displays specific intracortical structures such as the external band of Baillarger. The signal intensity profiles demonstrate the greatest hypointensity at the sites of maximum myelin concentration and maximum cell density and show gradations of signal intensity inversely proportional to varying cell density.MRM at 9.4 T depicts important aspects of the cytoarchitecture of normal formalin-fixed human cortex.},

All subjects had normal MRI scan and performed within normal range on a neuropsychological battery of tests. CC was segmented into seven functionally relevant regions using a previously published probabilistic map of the CC connectivity. We measured the volumes of the CC and its subregions. We used a regression model (with volumes as dependent and age as independent variables) and compared the slopes between carriers and noncarriers using an analysis of covariance model. We also carried out voxel-based-morphometry analysis to investigate the possible effect of the APOE epsilon4 gene on the gray matter.We found that the volume of the CC and all subregions decreased with increasing age in both groups. The slope was steeper in the APOE epsilon4 carriers compared withthe noncarriers particularly in the prefrontal region (P = 0.02). No gray matter differences were observed between the two groups.APOE epsilon4 polymorphism is associated with accelerated age-related volume loss in the prefrontal callosal tracts without gray matter loss. This result suggests the role of APOE epsilon4 in the brain aging by primarily affecting white matter structures particularly in the frontal lobe.},

Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of eﬀort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects. The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject test-retest studies, as well as by comparison of cross-subject regional thickness measures with published values.},

This work reports the use of spiral-in trajectories that begin at the edge of k-space and end at the origin, and spiral in/out trajectories in which a spiral-in readout is followed by a conventional spiral-out trajectory. The spiral-in trajectory reduces the dropout and increases the BOLD contrast. The spiral-in and spiral-out images can be combined in several ways to simultaneously achieve increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced dropout artifacts. Activation experiments employing an olfaction task demonstrate significantly increased activation volumes due to reduced dropout, and overall increased SNR in all regions.},

The advent of 3.0 T magnets has allowed reduction in exogenous contrast dose without compromising overall image quality. The use of novel intravascular contrast agents substantially increases the image windows and decreases contrast dose. Additionally, the lower risk and cost in non-contrast enhanced (NCE) MRA has sparked renewed interest in these methods. This article discusses the current state of both contrast-enhanced (CE) and NCE-MRA. New CE-MRA methods take advantage of dose reduction at 3.0 T, novel contrast agents, and parallel imaging methods. The risks of gadolinium-based contrast media, and the NCE-MRA methods of time-of-flight, steady-state free precession, and phase contrast are discussed.},

In terms of clinical utility, however, a more important issue concerns the ability of the technique to differentiate between normal elderly control subjects and AD patients with the very mildest form of the disease. We performed MRI-based volumetric measurements of the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala in 126 cognitively normal elderly control subjects and 94 patients with probable AD. The diagnosis of AD was made according to NINDS/ADRDA criteria, and disease severity was categorized by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. Patients with CDR 0.5 were classified as very mild, CDR 1 as mild, and CDR 2 as moderate disease severity. Volumes of each structure declined with increasing age in control subjects and did so in parallel for men and women. The volume of each measured MTL structure also declined with age in patients with AD. The volume of each MTL structure was significantly smaller in AD patients than control subjects (p < 0.001). Of the several MTL measures, the total hippocampal volumetric measurements were best at discriminating control subjects from AD patients. The mean hippocampal volumes for AD patients relative to control subjects by severity of disease were as follows: very mild AD (CDR 0.5) -1.75 SD below the control mean, mild AD (CDR 1) -1.99 SD, and moderate AD (CDR 2) -2.22 SD. Age- and gender-adjusted, normalized MRI-based hippocampal volumetric measurements provide a sensitive marker of the MTL neuroanatomic degeneration in AD early in the disease process.},

	abstractnote = {In this work, the safety aspects of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) systems are reviewed. Focus is placed on the interaction between the electric and magnetic fields generated by such instruments and the human body. An understanding of these interactions has become ever more important with the push to higher field strengths. Knowledge of MRI safety can not only guide RF coil and pulse sequence design but can also affect sequence selections, thereby ensuring safe and efficient system operation. Due to the signal to noise advantages of high field MRI systems, increases in the static magnetic field are inevitable. However, in addition to the static magnetic field, power intense sequences, fast gradient switching, and localized imaging/spectroscopy all have the potential of subjecting the human body to intense magnetic and electric field fluctuations. This further accentuates the need for a detailed understanding of the effects of exposure to these fields. In this work, some of the issues addressed are new, while others are well established. In either case, it is hoped that this compilation will enable all of us to pay greater attention to these matters and increase the current state of understanding through novel experimental studies. The discussion broadens the range of radio frequency effects to the microwave limit. This was accomplished in view of the latest efforts for realization of ultra high field (UHF) human MRI. In this regard, recently constructed ultra high field whole body systems will provide a new testing ground for safety issues. The proliferation of high field (1.0–3.0 tesla), very high field (3.0–7.0 tesla), and ultra high field (≥7 tesla) whole body MRI’s calls for a review of the safety literature that can guide future studies of critical health related issues. An effort has been made to present an up to date analysis of the biological effects within MR, covering a wide range of properties from cellular and physiological to clinical. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {To determine initial locus and rate of degeneration of temporal lobe structures (total lobe, hippocampus and parahippocampus) in preclinical dementia.Postmortem studies suggest that the earliest changes in Alzheimer's disease are neurofibrillary tangle formation in hippocampus and adjacent cortex. MRI volume analysis of temporal lobe structures over time in subjects prior to developing dementia may allow the identification of when these processes begin, the rate they develop, and which areas are key to symptom development.30 nondemented (NoD), healthy, elderly individuals enrolled in a prospective study of healthy aging evaluated annually over a mean of 42 months. Twelve subjects with subsequent cognitive decline were assigned to the preclinical dementia group (PreD). All 120 annual MRI studies analyzed by volumetric techniques assessed group differences in temporal lobe volumes and rates of brain loss.NoD as well as PreD subjects had significant, time-dependent decreases in hippocampal and parahippocampal volume. Rates of volume loss between the groups did not significantly differ. PreD cases had significantly smaller hippocampi when asymptomatic. Parahippocampal volume did not differ between PreD and NoD cases. Significant time-dependent temporal lobe atrophy was present only in PreD.Hippocampal and parahippocampal atrophy occurs at a similar rate regardless of diagnostic group. Those who develop dementia may have smaller hippocampi to begin with, but become symptomatic because of accelerated loss of temporal lobe volume. Temporal lobe volume loss may mark the beginning of the disease process within six years prior to dementia onset.},

This paper examines the precision of this algorithm, its optimal performance parameters, and the sensitivity of the method to subtle, focal changes in cortical thickness. The precision of cortical thickness measurements was studied using a simulated population study and single subject reproducibility metrics. Cortical thickness was shown to be a reliable method, reaching a sensitivity (probability of a true-positive) of 0.93. Six different cortical thickness metrics were compared. The simplest and most precise method measures the distance between corresponding vertices from the white matter to the gray matter surface. Given two groups of 25 subjects, a 0.6-mm (15\%) change in thickness can be recovered after blurring with a 3-D Gaussian kernel (full-width half max = 30 mm). Smoothing across the 2-D surface manifold also improves precision; in this experiment, the optimal kernel size was 30 mm.},

	abstract = {Axonal degeneration of white matter fibers is a key consequence of neuronal or axonal injury. It is characterized by a series of time-related events with initial axonal membrane collapse followed by myelin degradation being its major hallmarks. Standard imaging cannot differentiate these phenomena, which would be useful for clinical investigations of degeneration, regeneration and plasticity. Animal models suggest that diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is capable of making such distinction. The applicability of this technique in humans would permit inferences on white matter microanatomy using a non-invasive technique. The surgical bisection of the anterior 2/3 of the corpus callosum for the palliative treatment of certain types of epilepsy serves as a unique opportunity to assess this method in humans. DTI was performed on three epilepsy patients before corpus callosotomy and at two time points (1 week and 2-4 months) after surgery. Tractography was used to define voxels of interest for analysis of mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy and eigenvalues. Diffusion anisotropy was reduced in a spatially dependent manner in the genu and body of the corpus callosum at 1 week and remained low 2-4 months after the surgery. Decreased anisotropy at 1 week was due to a reduction in parallel diffusivity (consistent with axonal fragmentation), whereas at 2-4 months, it was due to an increase in perpendicular diffusivity (consistent with myelin degradation). DTI is capable of non-invasively detecting, staging and following the microstructural degradation of white matter following axonal injury.},

We measured A-weighted root-mean-square sound pressure levels and peak impulse sound pressure levels for EPI, under the same conditions, in eleven clinical super-conducting MRI systems. We also compared sound pressure levels for the EPI and six different pulse sequences and analyzed the acoustic noise spectra. Sound pressure levels during the use of the EPI differed greatly among institutions. Moreover, sound pressure levels of the EPI were not significantly different from those of other fast pulse sequences and were within permissible noise exposure levels. In comparison to other fast sequences, the EPI had significantly greater acoustic noise in the high-octave band frequency.},

	abstract = {Human cerebral cortex develops extremely fast in the first year of life. Quantitative measurement of cortical development during this early stage plays an important role in revealing the relationship between cortical structural and high-level functional development. This paper presents a computational growth model to simulate the dynamic development of the cerebral cortex from birth to 1 year old by modeling the cerebral cortex as a deformable elastoplasticity surface driven via a growth model. To achieve a high accuracy, a guidance model is also incorporated to estimate the growth parameters and cortical shapes at later developmental stages. The proposed growth model has been applied to 10 healthy subjects with longitudinal brain MR images acquired at every 3 months from birth to 1 year old. The experimental results show that our proposed method can capture the dynamic developmental process of the cortex, with the average surface distance error smaller than 0.6 mm compared with the ground truth surfaces, and the results also show that 1) the curvedness and sharpness decrease from 2 weeks to 12 months and 2) the frontal lobe shows rapidly increasing cortical folding during this period, with relatively slower increase of the cortical folding in the occipital and parietal lobes.},

RESULTS: All of the test infants exhibited substantial changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and/or oxygen saturation during the MR examination. No such changes were observed in the control infants. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that undergoing an MR examination may alter the vital signs of term newborn infants.},

Further measurements on four of the closed-bore systems surveyed showed that: 1) pulse sequence parameters (particularly FOV and TR) were more influential in determining noise level than field strength, 2) the noise level was found to vary along the z-direction with a maximum near the bore entrance, and 3) in one of two systems tested there was a significant increase in noise with a volunteer present instead of a test object.

Six subjects who terminated the examination before completion also completed exit interviews.

Anxiety was associated with the constrictive dimensions of the magnet bore, examination duration, coil noise, and temperature within the bore.

	abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal and progressive neurodegenerative disease that is accompanied by involuntary movements, cognitive dysfunction, and psychiatric symptoms. Although progressive striatal degeneration is known to occur, little is known about how the disease affects the cortex, including which cortical regions are affected, how degeneration proceeds, and the relationship of the cortical degeneration to clinical symptoms. The cortex has been difficult to study in neurodegenerative diseases primarily because of its complex folding patterns and regional variability; however, an understanding of how the cortex is affected by the disease may provide important new insights into it.Novel automated surface reconstruction and high-resolution MR images of 11 patients with HD and 13 age-matched subjects were used to obtain cortical thickness measurements. The same analyses were performed on two postmortem brains to validate these methods.Regionally specific heterogeneous thinning of the cortical ribbon was found in subjects with HD. Thinning occurred early, differed among patients in different clinical stages of disease, and appeared to proceed from posterior to anterior cortical regions with disease progression. The sensorimotor region was statistically most affected. Measurements performed on MR images of autopsy brains analyzed similarly were within 0.25 mm of those obtained using traditional neuropathologic methods and were statistically indistinguishable.The authors propose that the cortex degenerates early in disease and that regionally selective cortical degeneration may explain the heterogeneity of clinical expression in HD. These measures might provide a sensitive prospective surrogate marker for clinical trials of neuroprotective medications.},

To determine if prefrontal tissue volumes distinguish healthy aging from Alzheimer disease (AD).Volumes of total prefrontal cortex, prefrontal gray matter, and prefrontal white matter were compared among young healthy elderly (YHE) (n = 14; mean age, 70 years), old healthy elderly (OHE) (n = 14; mean age, 90 years), and subjects with AD (n = 14; mean age, 70 years) by analysis of variance. Additionally, Pearson correlations were performed between volumes and age.Old healthy elderly and subjects with AD had significantly less total prefrontal volume (approximately 15\% less in both groups) and prefrontal white matter volume (approximately 30\% less and 20\% less in the OHE and AD groups, respectively) than YHE, but there were no differences between the OHE and AD groups. There was a significant difference in gray-white matter volume ratio with OHE having a higher ratio than YHE. Subjects with AD did not differ from YHE or OHE in this ratio. There were significant negative correlations between age and total prefrontal volume and age and prefrontal white matter volume in the healthy subjects.In the very old, the decline of white matter volume is disproportionately greater than the decline of gray matter volume. In subjects with AD both gray and white matter loss contribute to the decline of prefrontal volume. This is demonstrated by the gray-white matter ratio that does not differ between YHE and subjects with AD. Thus, it is likely that AD is different from accelerated aging.},

The history of human exposure to magnetic fields is reviewed, and the contradictory nature of the literature regarding effects on human health is described. In the absence of ferromagnetic foreign bodies, there is no replicated scientific study showing a health hazard associated with magnetic field exposure and no evidence for hazards associated with cumulative exposure to these fields. The very high degree of patient safety in strong magnetic fields is attributed to the small value of the magnetic susceptibility of human tissues and to the lack of ferromagnetic components in these tissues. The wide range of susceptibility values between magnetic materials and human tissues is shown to lead to qualitatively differing behaviors of these materials when they are exposed to magnetic fields.

The magnet has an inductance of 1289 H and a stored energy of 33.4 MJ at rated field. The health of a group of 11 volunteers who had varying degrees of exposure to this field was followed over a 12-month period and no change that could be associated with this exposure was detected. A mild level of sensory experiences, apparently associated with motion within the field of the magnet, was reported by some of the volunteers during some of their exposures. A questionnaire regarding sensory effects associated with magnetic resonance scanners and possibly caused by the static magnetic field of these instruments, was given to nine respondents who had experience within both 1.5-T scanners and this 4-T scanner and to another group of 24 respondents who had experience only within 1.5-T scanners. For the sensations of vertigo, nausea, and metallic taste there was statistically significant (p less than 0.05) evidence for a field-dependent effect that was greater at 4 T. In addition, there was evidence for motion-induced magnetophosphenes caused by motion of the eyes within the static field. These results indicate the practicality of experimental whole-body body scanners operating at 4 T and the possibility of mild sensory effects in humans associated with motion within a static magnetic field. The results also indicate the likelihood of a wide margin of safety for the exposure of noncompromised patients to the static fields of conventional magnetic resonance scanners operated at 1.5 to 2 T and below.},

Acoustic noise measurements were obtained from two different high field-strength MR systems (1.5 T, Siemens and General Electric Co.) under ambient noise conditions and the use of EPI and 3D-FSE pulse sequences. Parameters were selected to produce “worst case” acoustic noise levels. Acoustic noise recordings were made at the entrance, the center, and at the exit of the magnet bores with a specially designed microphone that was unperturbed by electromagnetic fields. The highest ambient noise levels (A-weighted scale) were 67 dB (Siemens: the same values were recorded at the center and at the exit) and 78 dB (General Electric Co.; recorded at the exit). The highest acoustic noise levels recorded during activation of the gradient magnetic fields were 114 dB (Siemens) and 115 dB (General Electric Co.) and those occurred at the centers of the MR systems with the use of the EPI technique. Gradient magnetic fields associated with the use of EPI and 3D-FSE techniques produced acoustic noise levels that were within permissible levels recommended by federal guidelines.},

	abstract = {We used magnetic resonance imaging and cortical matching algorithms to map gray matter density (GMD) in 176 normal individuals ranging in age from 7 to 87 years. We found a significant, nonlinear decline in GMD with age, which was most rapid between 7 and about 60 years, over dorsal frontal and parietal association cortices on both the lateral and interhemispheric surfaces. Age effects were inverted in the left posterior temporal region, where GMD gain continued up to age 30 and then rapidly declined. The trajectory of maturational and aging effects varied considerably over the cortex. Visual, auditory and limbic cortices, which are known to myelinate early, showed a more linear pattern of aging than the frontal and parietal neocortices, which continue myelination into adulthood. Our findings also indicate that the posterior temporal cortices, primarily in the left hemisphere, which typically support language functions, have a more protracted course of maturation than any other cortical region.},

	abstract = {In this review, the authors summarize the literature on brain morphological changes that occur throughout the human life span from childhood into old age. They examine changes observed postmortem and in vivo where various brain MRI analytic methods have been applied. They evaluate brain changes observed with volumetric image analytic methods and voxel-based morphometric methods that may be used to better localize where changes occur. The primary focus of the review is on recent studies using state-of-the-art cortical pattern-matching techniques to assess age-related changes in cortical asymmetries, gray matter distribution, and brain growth across various age spans. The authors attempt to integrate findings from the in vivo studies with results from postmortem studies and analyze the complicated question of when brain maturation stops and brain aging begins. Analyzing the regional patterns of change initiated at various ages may help elucidate relationships between changing brain morphology and changing cognitive functions that occur throughout life. Long-range longitudinal studies, correlations between imaging and postmortem data, and more advanced image acquisition and analysis technologies will be needed to fully interpret brain morphological changes observed in vivo in relation to development and aging.},

	abstract = {Although widespread neural atrophy is an inevitable consequence of normal aging, not all cognitive abilities decline as we age. For example, spoken language comprehension tends to be preserved, despite atrophy in neural regions involved in language function. Here, we combined measures of behavior, functional activation, and gray matter (GM) change in a younger (19-34 years) and older group (49-86 years) of participants to identify the mechanisms leading to preserved language comprehension across the adult life span. We focussed primarily on syntactic functions because these are strongly left lateralized, providing the potential for contralateral recruitment. In an functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we used a word-monitoring task to minimize working memory demands, manipulating the availability of semantics and syntax to ask whether syntax is preserved in aging because of the functional recruitment of other brain regions, which successfully compensate for neural atrophy. Performance in the older group was preserved despite GM loss. This preservation was related to increased activity in right hemisphere frontotemporal regions, which was associated with age-related atrophy in the left hemisphere frontotemporal network activated in the young. We argue that preserved syntactic processing across the life span is due to the shift from a primarily left hemisphere frontotemporal system to a bilateral functional language network.},

An outline is presented on certain general aspects of the termination of specific afferent fibers in layer IV in insectivora, rodents, carnivora and primates. The principal components of the cerebral cortex have been classified in two broad types: pyramidal cells, which account for nearly 70\% of the total population, and intrinsic neurons. We review different morphological characteristics of pyramidal cells and intrinsic neurons with a full description of cell varieties, dendritic morphology and several aspects of synaptic connectivity of intrinsic neurons in comparison between different species. Special attention has been paid to the description of spinous stellate cells which seems unique for a given animal species. We have reviewed intrinsic cortical circuits linking several neocortical layers, the distribution of dendritic plexuses, and the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections established between various neuronal categories. We finally review modern concepts of functional neocortical architecture based on the modular organization of the cerebral cortex, concluding that the cerebral cortex is rather uniform at en elementary level but the differences appear substantial when the comparison is made between different species.},

	abstractnote = {Progressive functional decline in the epilepsies is largely unexplained. We formed the ENIGMA-Epilepsy consortium to understand factors that influence brain measures in epilepsy, pooling data from 24 research centres in 14 countries across Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Australia. Structural brain measures were extracted from MRI brain scans across 2149 individuals with epilepsy, divided into four epilepsy subgroups including idiopathic generalized epilepsies (n =367), mesial temporal lobe epilepsies with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE; left, n = 415; right, n = 339), and all other epilepsies in aggregate (n = 1026), and compared to 1727 matched healthy controls. We ranked brain structures in order of greatest differences between patients and controls, by meta-analysing effect sizes across 16 subcortical and 68 cortical brain regions. We also tested effects of duration of disease, age at onset, and age-by-diagnosis interactions on structural measures. We observed widespread patterns of altered subcortical volume and reduced cortical grey matter thickness. Compared to controls, all epilepsy groups showed lower volume in the right thalamus (Cohen’s d = −0.24 to −0.73; P \&lt; 1.49 × 10−4), and lower thickness in the precentral gyri bilaterally (d = −0.34 to −0.52; P \&lt; 4.31 × 10−6). Both MTLE subgroups showed profound volume reduction in the ipsilateral hippocampus (d = −1.73 to −1.91, P \&lt; 1.4 × 10−19), and lower thickness in extrahippocampal cortical regions, including the precentral and paracentral gyri, compared to controls (d = −0.36 to −0.52; P \&lt; 1.49 × 10−4). Thickness differences of the ipsilateral temporopolar, parahippocampal, entorhinal, and fusiform gyri, contralateral pars triangularis, and bilateral precuneus, superior frontal and caudal middle frontal gyri were observed in left, but not right, MTLE (d = −0.29 to −0.54; P \&lt; 1.49 × 10−4). Contrastingly, thickness differences of the ipsilateral pars opercularis, and contralateral transverse temporal gyrus, were observed in right, but not left, MTLE (d = −0.27 to −0.51; P \&lt; 1.49 × 10−4). Lower subcortical volume and cortical thickness associated with a longer duration of epilepsy in the all-epilepsies, all-other-epilepsies, and right MTLE groups (beta, b \&lt; −0.0018; P \&lt; 1.49 × 10−4). In the largest neuroimaging study of epilepsy to date, we provide information on the common epilepsies that could not be realistically acquired in any other way. Our study provides a robust ranking of brain measures that can be further targeted for study in genetic and neuropathological studies. This worldwide initiative identifies patterns of shared grey matter reduction across epilepsy syndromes, and distinctive abnormalities between epilepsy syndromes, which inform our understanding of epilepsy as a network disorder, and indicate that certain epilepsy syndromes involve more widespread structural compromise than previously assumed.},

@article{Woods_2009,
	abstractnote = {While human auditory cortex is known to contain tonotopically organized auditory cortical fields (ACFs), little is known about how processing in these fields is modulated by other acoustic features or by attention. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and population-based cortical surface analysis to characterize the tonotopic organization of human auditory cortex and analyze the influence of tone intensity, ear of delivery, scanner background noise, and intermodal selective attention on auditory cortex activations. Medial auditory cortex surrounding Heschl’s gyrus showed large sensory (unattended) activations with two mirror-symmetric tonotopic fields similar to those observed in non-human primates. Sensory responses in medial regions had symmetrical distributions with respect to the left and right hemispheres, were enlarged for tones of increased intensity, and were enhanced when sparse image acquisition reduced scanner acoustic noise. Spatial distribution analysis suggested that changes in tone intensity shifted activation within isofrequency bands. Activations to monaural tones were enhanced over the hemisphere contralateral to stimulation, where they produced activations similar to those produced by binaural sounds. Lateral regions of auditory cortex showed small sensory responses that were larger in the right than left hemisphere, lacked tonotopic organization, and were uninfluenced by acoustic parameters. Sensory responses in both medial and lateral auditory cortex decreased in magnitude throughout stimulus blocks. Attention-related modulations (ARMs) were larger in lateral than medial regions of auditory cortex and appeared to arise primarily in belt and parabelt auditory fields. ARMs lacked tonotopic organization, were unaffected by acoustic parameters, and had distributions that were distinct from those of sensory responses. Unlike the gradual adaptation seen for sensory responses, ARMs increased in amplitude throughout stimulus blocks. The results are consistent with the view that medial regions of human auditory cortex contain tonotopically organized core and belt fields that map the basic acoustic features of sounds while surrounding higher-order parabelt regions are tuned to more abstract stimulus attributes. Intermodal selective attention enhances processing in neuronal populations that are partially distinct from those activated by unattended stimuli.},

The diffusion coefficients of water parallel and perpendicular to the long axis of the squid giant axon at 20 degrees C are (1.61 +/- 0.06) x 10(-5) cm2 s-1 and (1.33 +/- 0.09) x 10(-5) cm2 s-1, respectively, which yield an anisotropic diffusion ratio of 1.2 +/- 0.1. Water diffusion in the squid giant axon is therefore quite rapid and nearly isotropic, thus eliminating the possibility of a significant role for the longitudinally oriented neurofilaments in producing diffusional anisotropy within the axoplasm. In conjunction with our work on garfish nerves therefore, only membranes, either as numerous axonal membranes or as myelin (if present), remain to fulfill the role of the primary determinant of anisotropic water diffusion in nerve and in white matter.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new NMR imaging modality–MR diffusion tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not.},

	abstract = {The diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the effective self-diffusion tensor, Deff, are related to the echo intensity in an NMR spin-echo experiment. This relationship is used to design experiments from which Deff is estimated. This estimate is validated using isotropic and anisotropic media, i.e., water and skeletal muscle. It is shown that significant errors are made in diffusion NMR spectroscopy and imaging of anisotropic skeletal muscle when off-diagonal elements of Deff are ignored, most notably the loss of information needed to determine fiber orientation. Estimation of Deff provides the theoretical basis for a new MRI modality, diffusion tensor imaging, which provides information about tissue microstructure and its physiologic state not contained in scalar quantities such as T1, T2, proton density, or the scalar apparent diffusion constant.},

In this paper, a correction method based on phase-encoded reference measurement is described.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate if multimodality neuroimaging evaluation increases the detection of subtle focal cortical dysplasia as part of an epilepsy surgery evaluation. Three patients with normal magnetic resonance imaging and histopathological findings of focal cortical dysplasia were reviewed. Their magnetoencephalography recordings were performed on whole-head magnetoencephalography system. Magnetic resonance images were re-evaluated with special inspection in limited regions guided by magnetoencephalography spike localization. Two patients had ictal and interictal single photon emission computed tomography study after administration of Tc99m ECD. In two patients we found tiny focal abnormalities including slightly increased cortical thickness and blurred gray-white matter junction at the locations of interictal events after re-evaluation of the MR images indicating focal cortical dysplasia. The third patient showed focal atrophic change. All patients are seizure free after surgery. Both ictal and interictal single photon emission computed tomography showed hyperperfusion in the dysplastic cortex regions. Multimodality neuroimaging study can improve the detection of focal cortical dysplasia. Normal magnetic resonance images should be re-evaluated for subtle signs of focal cortical dysplasia especially when magnetoencephalography recording demonstrate focal epileptic discharges.},

In this work, a nonlinear phase correction obviating the need for a reference scan is proposed.

The technique was used to analyze the phenotype of conditional Bcl-x knock-out mice, in which the bcl-x gene was deleted specifically in neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus beginning at embryonic day 13.5 as cells became postmitotic. Affected brain regions and associated axonal tracts showed severe atrophy in adult Bcl-x-deficient mice. Longitudinal studies revealed that these phenotypes are established by regressive processes that occur primarily during the first postnatal week, whereas neurogenesis and migration showed no obvious abnormality during embryonic stages. Specific families of white matter tracts that once formed normally during the embryonic stages underwent dramatic degeneration postnatally. Thus, this technique serves as a powerful tool to efficiently localize temporal and spatial manifestation of morphological phenotype.},

	abstract = {A subsecond magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for isotropic diffusion mapping is described which, in contrast to echo-planar imaging (EPI), is insensitive to resonance offsets, i.e., tissue susceptibility differences, magnetic field inhomogeneities, and chemical shifts. It combines a diffusion-weighted (DW) spin-echo preparation period and a high-speed stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) MRI sequence and yields single-shot images within measuring times of 559 msec (80 echoes). Here, diffusion encoding involved one scan without DW, three DW scans with b = 490 sec mm(-2), and three DW scans with b = 1000 sec mm(-2) (orthogonal gradient orientations). An automated on-line evaluation resulted in isotropic DW images as well as ADC maps (trace of the diffusion tensor). Experiments at 2.0 T covered the brain of healthy subjects in 20 contiguous sections of 6 mm thickness and 2.0 x 2.0 mm(2) in-plane resolution within a total measuring time of 78 sec. High-resolution studies at 1.0 x 1.0 mm(2) (interpolated from 2.0 x 1.0 mm(2) acquisitions) were obtained within 5 min 13 sec using four averages. In comparison with EPI, DW single-shot STEAM MRI exhibits only about half the SNR, but completely avoids regional signal losses, high intensity artifacts, and geometric distortions.},

In this work, a novel method that allows isotropic diffusion weighting to be obtained in a single radial k-space data set is presented. This is accomplished by altering the direction of diffusion weighting gradients between groups of TR periods, which yield sets of radial lines that possess diffusion weighting sensitive to motion in different directions. By altering the diffusion weighting directions and controlling the view ordering appropriately within the sequence, an effectively isotropic diffusion-weighted image can be obtained within one radial-FSE scan. The order in which radial lines are acquired can also be controlled to yield data sets without significant artifacts due to motion, T(2) decay, and/or diffusion anisotropy.},

@article{Reijmer_2012,
	abstractnote = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based fiber tractography (FT) is the most popular approach for investigating white matter tracts in vivo, despite its inability to reconstruct fiber pathways in regions with “crossing fibers.” Recently, constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) has been developed to mitigate the adverse effects of “crossing fibers” on DTI based FT. Notwithstanding the methodological benefit, the clinical relevance of CSD based FT for the assessment of white matter abnormalities remains unclear. In this work, we evaluated the applicability of a hybrid framework, in which CSD based FT is combined with conventional DTI metrics to assess white matter abnormalities in 25 patients with early Alzheimer’s disease. Both CSD and DTI based FT were used to reconstruct two white matter tracts: one with regions of “crossing fibers,” i.e., the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and one which contains only one fiber orientation, i.e. the midsagittal section of the corpus callosum (CC). The DTI metrics, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), obtained from these tracts were related to memory function. Our results show that in the tract with “crossing fibers” the relation between FA/MD and memory was stronger with CSD than with DTI based FT. By contrast, in the fiber bundle where one fiber population predominates, the relation between FA/MD and memory was comparable between both tractography methods. Importantly, these associations were most pronounced after adjustment for the planar diffusion coefficient, a measure reflecting the degree of fiber organization complexity. These findings indicate that compared to conventionally applied DTI based FT, CSD based FT combined with DTI metrics can increase the sensitivity to detect functionally significant white matter abnormalities in tracts with complex white matter architecture.},

Second, studies of in vitro and in vivo samples demonstrate correspondence between the orientational maxima of the diffusion spectrum and those of the fiber orientation density at each location. In specimens with complex muscular tissue, such as the tongue, diffusion spectrum images show characteristic local heterogeneities of fiber architectures, including angular dispersion and intersection.

	abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can provide information related to the arrangement of white matter fibers. The diffusion tensor is the model most commonly used to derive the orientation of the fibers within a voxel. However, this model has been shown to fail in regions containing several fiber populations with distinct orientations. A number of alternative models have been suggested, such as multiple tensor fitting, q-space, and Q-ball imaging. However, each of these has inherent limitations. In this study, we propose a novel method for estimating the fiber orientation distribution directly from high angular resolution diffusion-weighted MR data without the need for prior assumptions regarding the number of fiber populations present. We assume that all white matter fiber bundles in the brain share identical diffusion characteristics, thus implicitly assigning any differences in diffusion anisotropy to partial volume effects. The diffusion-weighted signal attenuation measured over the surface of a sphere can then be expressed as the convolution over the sphere of a response function (the diffusion-weighted attenuation profile for a typical fiber bundle) with the fiber orientation density function (ODF). The fiber ODF (the distribution of fiber orientations within the voxel) can therefore be obtained using spherical deconvolution. The properties of the technique are demonstrated using simulations and on data acquired from a volunteer using a standard 1.5-T clinical scanner. The technique can recover the fiber ODF in regions of multiple fiber crossing and holds promise for applications such as tractography.},

AFD has the potential to provide specific information regarding differences between populations by identifying not only the location, but also the orientations along which differences exist. In this work, analytical and numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to support the use of the FOD amplitude as a quantitative measure (i.e. AFD) for population and longitudinal analysis. To perform robust voxel-based analysis of AFD, we present and evaluate a novel method to modulate the FOD to account for changes in fibre bundle cross-sectional area that occur during spatial normalisation. We then describe a novel approach for statistical analysis of AFD that uses cluster-based inference of differences extended throughout space and orientation. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by performing voxel-based AFD comparisons between a group of Motor Neurone Disease patients and healthy control subjects. A significant decrease in AFD was detected along voxels and orientations corresponding to both the corticospinal tract and corpus callosal fibres that connect the primary motor cortices. In addition to corroborating previous findings in MND, this study demonstrates the clear advantage of using this type of analysis by identifying differences along single fibre bundles in regions containing multiple fibre populations.},

@article{DellAcqua_2012,
	abstractnote = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) methods are widely used to reconstruct white matter trajectories and to quantify tissue changes using the average diffusion properties of each brain voxel. Spherical deconvolution (SD) methods have been developed to overcome the limitations of the diffusion tensor model in resolving crossing fibers and to improve tractography reconstructions. However, the use of SD methods to obtain quantitative indices of white matter integrity has not been extensively explored. In this study, we show that the hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy (HMOA) index, defined as the absolute amplitude of each lobe of the fiber orientation distribution, can be used as a compact measure to characterize the diffusion properties along each fiber orientation in white matter regions with complex organization. We demonstrate that the HMOA is highly sensitive to changes in fiber diffusivity (e.g., myelination processes or axonal loss) and to differences in the microstructural organization of white matter like axonal diameter and fiber dispersion. Using simulations to describe diffusivity changes observed in normal brain development and disorders, we observed that the HMOA is able to identify white matter changes that are not detectable with conventional DTI indices. We also show that the HMOA index can be used as an effective threshold for in vivo data to improve tractography reconstructions and to better map white matter complexity inside the brain. In conclusion, the HMOA represents a true tract-specific and sensitive index and provides a compact characterization of white matter diffusion properties with potential for widespread application in normal and clinical populations.
