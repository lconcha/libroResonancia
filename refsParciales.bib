  abstract = {Anisotropic water diffusion in neural fibres such as nerve, white
	matter in spinal cord, or white matter in brain forms the basis for
	the utilization of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to track fibre
	pathways. The fact that water diffusion is sensitive to the underlying
	tissue microstructure provides a unique method of assessing the orientation
	and integrity of these neural fibres, which may be useful in assessing
	a number of neurological disorders. The purpose of this review is
	to characterize the relationship of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements
	of water diffusion and its anisotropy (i.e. directional dependence)
	with the underlying microstructure of neural fibres. The emphasis
	of the review will be on model neurological systems both in vitro
	and in vivo. A systematic discussion of the possible sources of anisotropy
	and their evaluation will be presented followed by an overview of
	various studies of restricted diffusion and compartmentation as they
	relate to anisotropy. Pertinent pathological models, developmental
	studies and theoretical analyses provide further insight into the
	basis of anisotropic diffusion and its potential utility in the nervous
	system.},

  abstract = {BOLD fMRI is hampered by dropout of signal in the orbitofrontal and
	parietal brain regions due to magnetic field gradients near air-tissue
	interfaces. This work reports the use of spiral-in trajectories that
	begin at the edge of k-space and end at the origin, and spiral in/out
	trajectories in which a spiral-in readout is followed by a conventional
	spiral-out trajectory. The spiral-in trajectory reduces the dropout
	and increases the BOLD contrast. The spiral-in and spiral-out images
	can be combined in several ways to simultaneously achieve increased
	signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced dropout artifacts. Activation
	experiments employing an olfaction task demonstrate significantly
	increased activation volumes due to reduced dropout, and overall
	increased SNR in all regions.},
